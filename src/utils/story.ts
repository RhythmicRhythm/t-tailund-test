  It was an unusually quiet evening at Hogwarts. The Gryffindor common room, often bustling with chatter and laughter, was subdued as students crammed for exams. Harry, Ron, and Hermione huddled around a parchment, their brows furrowed.

  "I swear, this spell isn't supposed to do that," Hermione said, tapping her wand nervously on the table. Earlier that day, she had stumbled upon Incantatio Vagari, a spell rumored to seek out forgotten magic. She had tried it in the library, but the result was bizarre. A faint, golden mist had swirled from her wand and disappeared into the ceiling.

  "Maybe it just didn’t work," Ron suggested, leaning back in his chair.

  Harry, however, wasn’t convinced. "What if it did? It could’ve gone anywhere in the castle."

  At that moment, a piercing howl echoed through the corridors, sending shivers down their spines. They exchanged uneasy glances before bolting out of the common room.

  The noise led them to the seventh-floor corridor, where a shimmering portal had appeared, crackling with energy. Out of it stepped a tall, shadowy figure clad in ancient robes.

  "Who dares summon me from the depths of time?" the figure bellowed.

  Hermione’s eyes widened. "That’s Ethelred the Enigmatic! A legendary spellcaster from the 14th century!"

  Before they could respond, the figure raised his wand, and a cascade of golden sparks erupted. Acting on instinct, Harry cast a shield charm while Hermione frantically flipped through her notes.

  "I didn’t mean to summon you!" Hermione shouted. "We’ll send you back!"

  "You must best me first," Ethelred sneered.

  The trio worked in harmony, Harry deflecting spells, Ron creating diversions, and Hermione crafting a counter-portal. With a final incantation, Ethelred was sucked back into the portal, leaving behind a faint whisper: "You are worthy."

  As the portal vanished, Ron let out a breath. "Next time, Hermione, let’s stick to the library’s approved spells."

  They laughed, their bond stronger than ever. Little did they know, the adventure had left a mysterious golden mist hovering in the air—ready to spark another tale.
